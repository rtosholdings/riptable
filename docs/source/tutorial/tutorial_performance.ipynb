    "Riptable uses multi-threaded and vectorized operations to work quickly and efficiently with large amounts of data. However, because memory is a finite resource, it's good to keep some things in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use universal functions (ufuncs) and ufunc methods. (Ufuncs take array inputs and produce array outputs.)\n",
    "- To work with a subset of an array, use slicing instead of fancy indexing. Fancy indexing creates a copy of the array. Slicing instead gives you a \"view\" of the array, though this means that changes to the slice change the original data as well. Another thing to be aware of is that a slice creates a reference to the original data. This means the original data won't be cleared from memory until the reference is also deleted.\n",
    "- In general, be aware of which operations make copies of data. Use flags to do operations in place when you can.\n",
    "- Avoid filtering entire Datasets using `ds.filter()`. Use Boolean mask arrays, or use filter keyword arguments in operations on columns.\n",
    "    - When it makes sense, you can use `ds.filter(inplace=True)` to modify the original Dataset.\n",
    "- Avoid string operations (creating strings, parsing strings, etc.). When you need to parse a string, use the FastArray string methods and try to do it in as few operations as possible.\n",
    "- Use Categoricals for string arrays, especially for repeated strings or if you're converting data between Pandas and Riptable. \n",
    "- Delete datasets you're not using. Though be aware that if you have any references to the Dataset in other objects (for example, a slice or any operation that gives you a \"view\" of the data), you might not actually free up memory.\n",
    "- Avoid using `apply()` -- it's not a vectorized operation. "
